Since Japanese teams first participated in the iGEM competition in 2006, multiple teams have consistently participated each year. However, currently, there are few Japanese iGEMers at the forefront of iGEM's diverse and expanding activities.

<br />
In Japan, we established the iGEM Japan Community, working in collaboration with the broader iGEM Community to expand our initiatives. However, these activities end in 2023.

<br />
During the iGEM Competition 2023, the Japan-United Team, originating from the iGEM Japan community, became the first finalist from Japan in iGEM's 20-year history and won the Grand Prize. Their success highlighted the challenges faced by previous Japanese teams.

<h2>Environment for Synthetic Biology in Japan</h2>

In Japan, numerous companies use cells to produce various products. Companies like Ajinomoto and Yamasa, with histories spanning over 100 years, still possess world-class synthetic biology technology and market share. These companies have developed unique technologies and expertise in human resource development. As such, joining such companies is often the preferred choice for those looking to apply synthetic biology in industry.

In this context, there is little motivation to launch startups based on synthetic biology, and the incentive for companies to actively support iGEMers is limited.

Additionally, the Japanese academic community in synthetic biology tends to focus on bottom-up biology, such as artificial cells, which is somewhat removed from applied research aimed at social implementation. As a result, some iGEM PIs have been distancing themselves from iGEM in recent years.

<h2>Japanese iGEMers</h2>

Nevertheless, there are Japanese people interested in iGEM. Their typically main motivation is "research training". They are interested in "research" but show little interest in the societal implementation of synthetic biology and research for synthetic biology. This lack of interest is a major reason for disengagement from iGEM after iGEM Competition.

This mindset is widespread in Japan, leading to a perception that the benefits of engaging with the iGEM community are small for those iGEMer not the field of synthetic biology. Consequently, efforts to expand the synthetic biology community are often passive.

<h2>Summary</h2>
In conclusion, challenges that were not apparent when the iGEM Japan Community was
first established have now become evident. Efforts to increase the number of engaged
and active iGEMers in synthetic biology have failed.

For the future, directly participating in the Global iGEM community is an attractive option for those in Japan aspiring to be leaders in societal change through synthetic biology. Kaisei Otake, leader of iGEM Japan United 2023, is an exemplary figure. His emergence as a role model has paved new paths for many in Japan.

While the "iGEM Japan Community" will conclude in 2023, we will continue to nurture Japanese talent interested in exploring the potential of synthetic biology within the "Global iGEM Community".
